# Wine Quality Prediction Project

In this project, I aim to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties. I have created two separate Jupyter notebooks for this project: one for red wine and one for white wine.

## Project Structure

- `RedWineQuality.ipynb`: This notebook contains my analysis and modeling for the red wine dataset. It includes data loading, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

- `WhiteWineQuality.ipynb`: This notebook contains my analysis and modeling for the white wine dataset. It follows the same structure as the red wine notebook.

## Key Findings

- **Alcohol Content:** For both red and white wines, I found that alcohol content is a significant predictor of quality. Wines with higher alcohol content generally tend to have higher quality.

- **Density:** There is a negative correlation between the density of a wine and its quality. Wines with higher density tend to have lower quality.

## Models Used

I trained several machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier. The Random Forest Classifier performed the best.

## How to Run

To run the notebooks, you need to have Jupyter installed. You can then clone this repository and run `jupyter notebook` in the project directory.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Collections, Termcolor, and Warnings.
